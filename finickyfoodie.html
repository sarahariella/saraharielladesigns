                <p class= "brief">The Project</p>
                <p class="brief-details">The goal of the project was to design an app where users are presented with recipes that 
                    exclude foods/ingredients that they dislike. A "suggested recipes" feature also needed 
                    to be included in our app. We had to come up with a way the app would be able to determine 
                    and filter out disliked foods of the user, and provide an excellent user experience as well. 
                    We were responsible for coming up with our own target market, as well as adding a feature that would make our 
                    app unique from other apps already on the market.</p>

                            <p>Picky eaters unite! Finicky Foodie is an app designed to make cooking enjoyable for everyone. 
                                Whether you have an allergy, follow a diet that restricts ingredients, or maybe just don’t 
                                like mushrooms, Finicky Foodie is the app for you. By creating a personalized and customizable 
                                experience, every Finicky Foodie account is unique to the user making the app feel personal. 
                                Filtering out ingredients, suggested recipes and even a grocery shopping list are 
                                just some of the features the app has to offer. Bon Apetit! </p>

                            <h2 class="brief-title">Problem</h2>
                            <p>We must consider that many people are not only cooking for themselves. It may be a roomate, sibling 
                                or significant other in which case sometimes trying new things might be something fun. However, with 
                                kids, it’s a whole different story. Having to come up with new recipes that your kids will actually 
                                want to eat can be exhausting, especially after a long day at work. Kids can be huge picky eaters, 
                                which means getting them to try new things seems like an impossible task to accomplish.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h2 class="brief-title">Solution</h2>
                            <p>After coming home from a long day at work, any user can feel confidant turning to the Finicky Foodie app 
                                for dinner ideas. Recipes are customized for allergies, dietary restrictions and picky eaters especially. 
                                The Kid-Friendly approach to the app allows for less complex recipes that are easy for any parent to follow, 
                                and for every kid to enjoy! By taking ingredients someone likes and filtering out ingredients someone doesn’t like, 
                                the result is a customized cookbook that will lead to trying new meals, but most importantly, making memories with 
                                food. </p>

                            <h2 class="brief-title">Approach</h2>
                            <p>In order to successfully develop this app, one must dive deep into understanding the user persona. What 
                                is it like in the day of the user? When will they realistically  be using the app? How often? How would 
                                using Finicky Foodie make their lives easier? Most importantly, how can we ensure that the user is going 
                                to continue using the app, not just download and delete? We’ll have to take a look at the competition to 
                                see what some apps are doing right, and what others are doing wrong. Looking at reviews can also help us 
                                understand why users get frustrated using recipe apps, and what gets them to become loyal users, which 
                                essentially is the end goal of Finicky Foodie. By using a sophisticated and colorful design, we want to 
                                make users happy, and keep them coming back for more.</p>

                <p class="brief-details">The unique feature that I came up with I decided to call "Recipe Magic". 
                    After researching other recipe apps, I noticed that they were all catered to the individual. 
                    I wanted to come up with something that would also be able to work in a group, specifically family, 
                    environment.</p>
                <p class="brief-details">The feature allows the main user of the account to select who is eating, and will 
                    then generate recipes based on the allergies, dietary restrictions, and dislikes of every user selected. 
                    I thought that this would be perfect for families with children. If one child has a peanut allergy, and 
                    another child dislikes onions, for example, the generated recipes will exclude both peanuts and onions, 
                    or offer substitute ingredient suggestions. This refers back to the solution of the project: creating a 
                    custom cookbook for every family.</p>

                    the app will look like. There are limited visuals and colors so that we can communicate the layout 
                    of the app without any distracting features. This was my favourite part of the process as it really 
                    played into how the interface would look like. These mid-fi wireframes began to bring my idea to life.</p>

                    I added more colors and photos as well as the logo of the app to the wireframes adding to the visual experience of the app. I also 
                    prototyped the app in Adobe XD to showcase how the app works. </p>

            <p class= "brief">Reflection</p>
            <p class="brief-details">What I learned from this project is just how important it is to really understand the target user. One must really 
                consider what features would truly benefit the user and make their experience a positive one. I believe a key part to this case study was 
                the user persona research and competitve analysis. In the user persona research, it was really important to empathize with the user; to put 
                yourself in their shoes. What is 'a day in the life' of the user? When would they be using your app? What makes the app an ideal solution to the 
                problem the user faces? It also helps us determine which features are the most essential to the user. Figuring out what features are the most 
                important and impactful to the user versus features that may not as essential. It gives us a very good starting point of what to focus on and 
                taught me a lot about understanding your target user.</p>
            <p class="brief-details">During the competitive analysis, I learned about how important it is to explore similar products (in this case other mobile 
                applications) that are out on the market. Conducting research on these apps, downloading them, and testing out their user experiences really helped 
                me to determine what I wanted to include in my own app design. For example, by reading user reviews of apps on the App Store, I was able to understand 
                why users enjoyed one app over another, and what features were important to users. For example, having customizability features was appreciated by users 
                with dietary restrictions, which made the decision for me to include dietary customizability essential. </p>
            <p class="brief-details">If I were to pick out what I would do differently next time, I think I would take even more time to truly understand the user and 
                refine my features. I included in my app a 'recipe magic' feature which I thought would be a unique feature to include in the app for families. Although 
                I still believe the idea was good, I wish I had spent more time refining the feature and making it easier to use. Looking back it seems a bit plain and 
                could have used a more thought out design considering it is a unique feature to the app.</p>
