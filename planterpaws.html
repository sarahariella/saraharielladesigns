            <p class="brief-details">The goal of the project was to design any product of our choosing that we would 
                have to 3D model and then print using a 3D printer. Due to the size of the printers available to us 
                at school, our product had to be a miniature 'prototype' size, about the size of a keychain. We had 
                to create our product in 3DS Max, and then export it to the 3D printing software "Tinkerine Suite" 
                which communicated our designs to the 3D printers. We had to choose materials, colors, as well as 
                provide digital renders of our designs. We also had to talk about printing settings we chose for our 
                prototypes and explain all of our decisions surrounding the prototype.</p>

            <p class= "brief">Planter Paws Concept</p>
            <p class="brief-details">Planter Paws are small sized planter pots that are customized to look like your very 
                own pet. The inspiration came from one of the things I love the most, my dogs. I have two dogs, one being 
                a mix of a Maltese and Yorkshire Terrier, and the other a Poodle and Yorkshire Terrier. I see some companies 
                sell keychains or stickers of dogs that I would potentially want to purchase, however, because both of my dogs 
                are mixed breeds, it is hard to find items that actually look like them (I’m sure many dog moms and dads 
                out there could tell you the exact same thing).</p>
            <p class="brief-details">I wanted to find a way to solve this problem that took a unique approach. 
                    When I was trying to think of a product I could customize to look like my dogs, the planter pot idea came to my head; perhaps 
                    thanks to my mom. Growing up one of the things I remember doing the most with my mom was gardening. She had all of these little 
                    collectible planters in the garden as well as inside. These memories gave me the inspiration of Planter Paws, however, I wanted to 
                    market the product as a small to medium size indoor planter that could be used as an office desk novelty item, a product that would 
                    be a perfect little customized gift.</p>

                <p class="brief-details"> Below is a digital sketch of my initial idea. The model I will be making does not include the plant, it was simply 
                    to show the product in use. I used the colors of my actual dog, and decided to also include a photo of the dog I decided to model so that 
                    one would be able to see the ‘cartoon’ look I was going for. I have also included the photo that I used as reference.</p>

            <div class ="project-details">
                <p class="brief-details"> Taking my idea from concept to creation was probably the most challenging. I have never done any organic modeling in 
                    any 3D software before, so I decided to go with a very geometric take on my sketch after several failed attempts at trying to create organic 
                    shapes. I was still happy with this concept because I felt as though it played into the cartoon look I was going for anyway, sort of Pop Funko 
                    inspired. I used cylinders for the base or ‘body’ of my object, half spheres for the paws, and a stretched sphere for the tail. By creating the 
                    base first, I was able to focus on creating something sturdy that would also lay flat remembering that when we print our objects, they will print 
                    more successfully lying flat. </p>
                <p class="brief-details"> For the head of my object, I used a cube, inset each polygon and basically extruded the ‘hair’ out of the cube by making 
                    these extrusions look triangular. I used a square based pyramid for the ears, spheres for the eyes and nose, and for the ‘scruff’ or hair details 
                    on the face, I created lines based on the sketch I had extruded them so that they were thicker and would actually slide into the face to assure that 
                    the lines were actually attached to the face and not floating.  </p>
                <img src="assets/images/planter_paws/planter_paws_screenshot.png">
                <p class="brief-details"> I chose to assign my object an acrylic material with similar colors to my sketch. I used the acrylic as my render material because 
                    I know that a lot of other planter pots are also made out of this material. It is waterproof, which is important since my object will be holding plants 
                    that need to be watered, and it is also a sturdy material as well. Evidently, I won’t be able to print in acrylic material, but I still had to think about 
                    what material my object would actually be made out of if it was a manufactured item.  </p>

                <p class="brief-details"> Tinkerine Suite is the in-between software we used from 3DS Max to 3D Printer at the Sandbox Studio located at Seneca College. In Tinkerine Suite, we are able to manipulate 
                different settings of our print such as infill, dimensions, resolution, etc. Here are the decisions I made and why. The dimensions of my object are 46.8mm x 55.6mm x 34.5mm according to Tinkerine Suite.</p>

            <div class ="project-details">
                <p class="brief-details"> I decided to go with a medium resolution for my object because even though the software only recommended a ‘low’ resolution, 
                    I wanted to make sure all the details on my object’s face came through. In the presentation about the Sandbox we were also told that most prints 
                    only need a low or medium resolution, so since my object had some details, I wanted to make sure they printed nice at a slightly higher quality.  </p>
            </div>
            <p class= "tink-detail-title">Infill</p>
            <div class ="project-details">
                <p class="brief-details"> I went with a 20% infill for my object. I knew my object did not have to be 100% dense, but I still wanted to have some 
                    interior structure to it knowing that if this object were to exist in real life it would have to be sturdy. I felt like 20% would be plenty also 
                    considering that my object isn’t that big either. During our presentation in class, 20% was also said to be a good infill to use.  </p>

            <div class ="project-details">
                <p class="brief-details"> I used a 2 setting for my walls. It was what the software recommended for my object, but I also know that due to the size of 
                    my object, my walls didn’t have to be too thick, however, I believe a level 1 would have been too thin. I feel confident in using a level 2 for my 
                    project.  </p>

            <div class ="project-details">
                <p class="brief-details"> I decided to use supports on the outside of my object, mostly because I was concerned about the head over-hanging the body. 
                    The support is underneath the head so it won’t be too bad to take off without any visual damage to the object. </p>
